Stopped playing RPG(maplestory lol), project is halted, After listening to a few credits, I thought it would be a problem, so I decided to start a project that I've been stashing for two years.

I've been determined to do it for a long time. Since 2013 or 2019, depends.

But after studying ECS  I thought I could start on this.



# What I did (in timely order)



## 1. Studied ECS Sample Project. (3/30-4/3)

To be honest, just played Oxygen not Included.

## 2. Make fluid system. (4/6~4/7)

Learned some of the concept of High Performance C#, ECS.

Triple buffer system to minimize memory copy/safe multithreading (I think it's crazy, but I've been thinking about it for a long time).

All calculations are very fast and deterministic, with all the calculations as integers.

â€»As I worked on this and that randomly, volume of fluid is not stable and vibrates. Will fix. ~~commit more often idiot~~

## 3. Rest (4/8)

Read some essays in libray.

## 4. Establish Surface Concepts (4/9-10)

Worked on some updates order. ([Code](https://github.com/Yukinyaa/StuckOnMoon2021/blob/194364cd799731d046ee8b5ec950c4f6b43c9c96/Assets/Scripts/EngineComponents/Surface/SurfaceController.cs))

Revisited HPC#, Burst Compiler, IL code concept.

After the update, I feel like I can use a little ECS during Render preparation (translation in grid coordinate system > general unity coordinate system)



## 5. Get ready for the next week (4/10).

I think I should do something about putting blocks, mining resources, and smelting. I think I'm done with the system basic concept.

So, basically Terraria clone.



# Retrospect

1. Single commit. [6671284](https://github.com/Yukinyaa/StuckOnMoon2021/commit/6671284d82eec831b5050da3b5ec7ad3b4a3f89b) Let's commit often (worked the wrong directory so change didn't get registerd... I'm losing my mind)
2. Eat coffee and work. Why play LOL? Waste of energy.
3. Stop playing ONI DLC. Just don't do it. The mid-end game looks really long.
