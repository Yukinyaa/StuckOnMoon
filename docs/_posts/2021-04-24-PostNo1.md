## Some backstory

Well, with some exaggeration, I have been planning this game since 2012.

Even though I wanted to work on this game for years, I had doubt about my programming/self-management skill.
For few years, I worked on multiple(around 10) game projects, been on multiple small to big teams.

After four years of experience, I finally decided to work on this game.

I've wored on this game for a month now. And have been sharing my progress on school club page weekly.
Since I enjoyed some love from few peoples, I decided to global.

## Future Plans

I'm planning to post weekly, but post will be more frequent since there is a lot to introduce.
Oh, and also, most post will be programming related since my problem is mostly programming currently :)

Game roadmap and introduction will be updated on main page soon!
