Implementing placing blocks on a map (difficulty level hard:tm:)

Since Stellaris's Nemesis DLC came out, and cause my sis's "vacation", I only had three days.



# What I did (in timely order)

## 14, last week's development.

## 13-15 Implementing block place without chunk

![img](https://con.cien.or.kr/download/thumbnails/76808315/Honeycam%202021-04-19%2001-32-16.gif?version=1&modificationDate=1618763551625&api=v2)

No graphics, no fancy stuff. I wasn't satisfied, but I think I finished implementing anyway.

Collision with composite collider, insert graphics, chunking, "eventize" block placement

There's a lot more to do, but close enough.

## 16th~

Stellaris Nemesis DLC (lol stil not done with it)


# Other designed content

It's all organized in my head, but I think I should write it down.

First, the project borrows the concept of Unitiy Data-oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) and utilizes several systems, but is self-developed by the Entity-Components System, the flower of DOTS.(future me here. no. I ditched DOTS system entirely.)

I already had a concept in mind, and I wanted to use them...

## Factory Game Update Time

A factory game is a simulation of hundreds of thousands of factories and thousands of logistics systems that assist them, and hundreds of thousands of items that are moved, produced, crushed, mined.

Naturally, the calculations are bound to be enormous, so we have no choice but to care about optimization.

## Fundamentals of DOTS

We make the most of cache by physically placing all the elements needed for the calculation close to memory (Note](http://contents.kocw.net/KOCW/document/2015/shinhan/leedonggyu/9.pdf), search keywords: Cache, Cache block size, Cache Hit/Miss)

Simply put, it is much faster to process things that are close at memory at once, then to read and process scattered things one by one.(I've never optimized this far, but I learned so at lectures too.)

It would be incomparably faster to simply copy an array than to copy an scattered structure like linked list.

With this in mind, it's better to have relative information all in one place as much as possible.

But if you do this, it's easy to update a single object, but it's a bit tricky to implement the interaction.

Additionally, as memory changes occur, other threads referring to that memory become incredibly slow.

So I came up with this idea.

# Double Buffer Data

![img](https://con.cien.or.kr/download/attachments/76808315/image2021-4-19_2-25-16.png?version=1&modificationDate=1618766718900&api=v2)

I have designed a way to lock the data used in the last frame (update) using double buffers and use it for this frame.

For most update calculations, referr to the data in the last frame, and do not affect the other update task of this frame as much as possible.

The data in the last frame is locked, so the CPU will be able to read this data as comfortably like a constant, and you only have to think about how to interact well with the data in this frame.

I know this looks like techy BS, but also adding buffer number 3, you can save without interruption! (1>2>3 (save)>1>2>1>2>1>2)



It's a triple buffer system that's already been applied to the fluid update system, and I'm thinking of... pushing this to end.I know it's hard, but...

# What's next?

chunking >> block placement event >> liquid system register system/pipes addition >> water creation/deletion>> inventory system>> block ghost/construction command system

I need to change my name to liquid>fluid. bad luck

# Retrospect

I should've just written about the chunk and the AABB collison. This looks like just BS,
